# A process to create products on Etsy

No explanation, no fluff, just the process. 

1. Browse a different niche from your own

Soccer Shirt -> Weekends, Coffee, and Soccer

2. Adapt it to your own niche. 

Niche example: Coding

Coding Shirt -> Weekends, Coffee, and Code
Coding Shirt -> Weekends, Coffee, and Javascript
Coding Shirt -> Weekends, Coffee, and Python
Coding Shirt -> Weekends, Coffee, and Java

3. Draw up many different designs, good and bad, in Canva

4. Don't create the items yet, just keep brainstorming

5. Next day, fix the items that need a little bit more, and select the best ones to create listings on Etsy
