# The best spotify playlists for coding (Studying/Concentration/Flow State)

All of these playlists are great for getting into the flow state.

Flow state from wikipedia: [Flow (psychology)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) "In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity."

## Top 3:

1. [Music to Code by](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iNenOLfxDf94ZF9OZA8fd?si=cc9b447b7eae4b7f) by [prosimie](https://open.spotify.com/user/prosimie?si=fa3048c39b944f16)

This playlist is great for getting into a state of flow. The playlist consists of 589 tracks and has frequent updates as recently as October 5, 2021. The song selection inspires creativity and provides background noise without breaking focus.

2. [Focus Music: Work | Studying | Concentration](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7xmpNYZ15D6b43BHzYQCLt?si=e1049a85182f4d46) by [Kroschi](https://open.spotify.com/user/kroschi?si=7c9aa558422340ac)
   This playlist is great for getting into a state of flow. The playlist consists of 1685 tracks and has frequent updates as recently as October 5, 2021. This playlist has a huge amount of piano and classical influcences. It's great for a focus session or any time you just want to sit a write, think, or drink a cup of coffee. Although _Music to Code by_ was my favorite for longer, this playlist is currently a top pick!

3. [Pomodoro Study Jams](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0lcj3Gmygqlm6FZHu5mDnA?si=69b0241f9efb462f) by [Amyg\_\_dala](https://open.spotify.com/user/3f0l1wp6kyswk0ogeno8e58gc?si=ecd90efd11b948ee)
