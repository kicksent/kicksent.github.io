title: How to speak (from an MIT professor)
---

Note: These notes are just notes. A summary of the ideas in the video linked at the bottom.

## How to start

- ~~ Joke ~~
- Promise of value - tell people what they are going to know at the end that they didn't know at the beginning

## Samples

- Cycle: Tell them what you want to tell them, tell them again, and then tell them a third time.
- Build a fence around your idea so that it's not confused with someone else's idea. Explain it's purpose and scope.
- Verbal punctiation: Since people may tune out, give landmarks where listeners can get back on the bus.
- Question: Ask a question and give some empty space for people to think of answers. (7+ seconds)
