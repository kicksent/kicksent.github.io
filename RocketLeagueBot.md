### My Rocket League Bot

{% include gallery caption="[Check out my bot on github. ](https://github.com/kicksent/my_rlbot)" %}

## Motivation for this project

In recent years I have spent much of my free time playing Rocket League. I have found it to be a game of never ending complexity and skill which has kept me involved for a number of years. I stumbled upon [this][1] reddit post a year ago and began my journey. Today, there is a rich rocket league bot creating community with their own [subreddit][2] and [discord channel][3]. 

Since I discovered Rocket League Bots many improvements have been made to make setup and creation easier than ever before. I highly recommend checking it out.
* [RLBOT github][4] now supports 5 languages. 
* [RLBOT wiki][5]

## Why make Rocket League Bots?

Rocket League allows players to rotate their car in all 3 axes, jump, and boost to fly. The game has a high demand for precise input to play at a high level and to control the car in an effective manner. Thus, using computers to control the cars feels a bit like cheating. In addition, the tournaments and discord are a great place to meet others who share love for game bots.

## TODO 3/25/2019

* ATBA improvements
* Aerial progress
* Time to touch calculations
