### Brain dump

On Friday I was feeling stressed. It was a bit of a slow day and I just had a lot on my mind. I have found that I often don't take action on any of my work/hobbies/desires when I have too many things on my mind. It can be difficult to choose one of my tasks and get started. I simply have this long list of to-dos in my mind and can't seem to stick with one. Even when I do select a task, I am often interrupted with worries about forgetting the details of another task. This brain dump will help me to get some of those ideas and concerns out of my head and into this document.

### Scheduling my work and hobbies

My room mate and I love to go bouldering. However, there was a 6 week period where we stopped going. We just couldn't find the time to go. However, after scheduling it for Mondays and Thursdays we haven't missed once. Schedules work for me because I can plan around it, and I don't have to decide to go. The decision has already been made. I want to apply this to other activities to see if it works for me.
