### The Basics of Cryptocurrency Arbitrage

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}


## Motivation for this post

Many have given up on cryptocurrency since the end of 2018 when the price of BTC began falling from its peak of nearly $20,000. Today BTC is only $4060, the markets have cooled, and the subreddits have become stale and inactive. This post is purely for fun and for sharing some ideas I have had about this space. There are some hurdles involved in cryptocurrency arbitrage that are unique. 


## What is arbitrage?

If you haven't heard about arbitrage, it's quite simple. Arbitrage is the buying and selling of an asset while taking advantage of the differing prices on the market. For example, many people buy items on craigslist to resell on ebay. The reason this works well for many, is because ebay is a much larger market(which theoretically leads to fairer prices on average). This means that finding a good deal on a popular item on craigslist will usually net a profit. 

## Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Problems

Buy some cryptocurrency, move it to another exchange, and sell it for a slight profit. Simple, but there are three hurdles to consider: 
1. Exchanges charge a rate for trading or purchasing cryptocurrency. The range varies between free and .2% of the trade. 
2. Although large exchanges in my experience haven't charged for transfer, smaller exchanges often charge a flat rate to transfer currency no matter how much cryptocurrency you move. 
3. Most importantly in most cases, it can take a significant amount of time(over an hour) for the first exchange to move the currency over to the second exchange. 

Note: It is possible to find exchanges where trades and transfers are free. However, for coins like BTC, LTC, and ETH the time to move currency between exchanges will always be an issue. 

## Getting around #3

One method for getting around #3 is to trade your slow coin(BTC for example) into a faster moving coin(NANO) and move the NANO instead of the BTC. In this example, you still have to worry about problem #1 and #2 but at least you can get the funds to transfer more quickly. However, #3 is still dependent on the exchange becuase although the coin may be nearly instant, some exchanges wait on the backend for a period of time before initiating the transfer. This means it could still save 5-10 minutes for the transfer to occur, which can often wipe out the profits in the process. 


## Final thoughts 

There are methods which are faster than the one mentioned above. It is possible to realize profits for a coin like BTC nearly instantly. Can you think of a superior method? What kinds of problems arise with your solution?
