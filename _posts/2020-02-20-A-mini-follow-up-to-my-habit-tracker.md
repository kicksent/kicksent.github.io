# Habit tracking part 2:

## Reiterating my goals for my habit tracker

This is a follow up to the first post I made about this topic. I have been using the habit tracker for a couple months. This is mainly just a note to myself to express my thoughts and dedicate some time to thinking deeply about what I can do to improve on this process.

To create successful habits, I am using techniques from the book Atomic Habits. I have also found good success with pairing a new habit with an existing behavior.

1. Make queue obvious.
2. Make craving attractive.
3. Make response easy.
4. Make reward satisfying.

## Redesign habits that aren't working!

I have been using a habit tracker to track new habits and find out which ones are working and which arent. If a habit is too difficult and I haven't been executing on it then it needs to be broken down into a smaller goal, easier habit, or removed entirely and replaced so that I can again make progress on it. I've tried to remind myself that being hard on myself about failing a habit is not a solution.

## Habits:

### Working for me:

- Get ready for bed at 9
- Be in bed at 9:30
- Wake up at 5:30 AM
- Drink full glass of water when I wake up
- Use my habit app
- Audiobooks in the car(this one is very satisfying and easy to maintain)
- Gym when I get home from work or in the morning if I work from home
- Read one dev.to article every work day

### Not working for me:

- Coding my side project everyday (this one is very important to me but I struggle to work consistently on it)
- Visualization of future self
- Korean language podcasts
- Laundry on a regular schedule so it doesn't build up

## How to break apart a desired habit that isn't working

### Example: Writing down something in my journal every day.

- Make it easy: The minimum requirement for success on this habit is to simply pull out the journal and put it on my desk.
- Stack it: I take this journal out when I get out my laptop for work.
- Make it simple: It doesn't matter what I write, sketch, or just scribble some bullet points. It all counts.
- Make it flexible: Some days I write a little, some days I write a lot, and some days not at all.
