After listening to [Rich Dad, Poor Dad]() on audible, I have been searching for resources to help me acquire assets. I decided to search the asset store for some resources to get practice. I decided I would post my thoughts about what I learned and how I feel about these games. I have an android device so I will only be talking about games available on [Google Play]().
