## Vermin: Platformer developed in Unity
I worked on this project after work for a few months working on this game. Project is on pause in favor of another game I am working on now. 
#### Notable features:
  - camera
  - mechanics
  - custom shader
  - dialogue system
  - boss composed of distinct states for each attack which run async
  - art assets
  - animation
  - game states
