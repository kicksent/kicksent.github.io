## My Rocket League Bot

{% include gallery caption="[Check out my bot on github.](https://github.com/kicksent/my_rlbot)" class="full" %}

### Motivation for this project

In recent years I have spent much of my free time playing Rocket League. I have found it to be a game of never ending complexity and skill which has kept me involved for a number of years. I stumbled upon [this][1] reddit post a year ago and began my journey. Today, there is a rich rocket league bot creating community with their own [subreddit][2] and [discord channel][3]. 

Since I discovered Rocket League Bots many improvements have been made to make setup and creation easier than ever before. I highly recommend checking it out.
* [RLBOT github][4] now supports 5 languages. 
* [RLBOT wiki][5]

### Why make Rocket League Bots?

- build a personal project to put on your resume
- learn or solidify Linear Algebra concepts
  - vectors
  - physics in 3D world coordinate system (position, velocity, acceleration)
  - matrix transformations (mainly translation and rotation)
  - projections
- use tools to affect game state, render lines for ball predicitons, and more
- meet others who share love for game bots
