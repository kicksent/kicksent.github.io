## Trie Python

Autocompletion trie searches for items in the data structure and returns true if found. 

### Cases: 

There are some interesting cases like the and `the` and `these` which must be accounted for using a node which tells us this is the eding of a word. Otherwise, inserting `these` will make it seem like `the` is a word in the data structure. 

                       root
                    /   \    \
                    t   a     b
                    |   |     |
                    h   p     i
                    |   |     |
                    o   p     t
                 /  |   |
                 s  u   l
                 |  |   |
                 e  g   e
                    |   
                    h   
                    |
                    t
