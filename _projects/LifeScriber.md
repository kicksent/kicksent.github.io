## Journal Swap App (lifescriber.com)

[lifescriber.com][1]

### Motivation for this project

### Inspiration

My father and I have picked up a new hobby recently together. Each of us have a journal, and we periodically swap them when we see each other. There are no rules about what to write. Sometimes I just write about my thoughts after waking up or what I did that day. It doesn't even matter if we know what each other are talking about. Just write whatever. It's really exciting to see what the other person wrote when you swap the journals back. At first, it was a bit tricky to remember to write, but it is amazing now. I think when my dad is long gone I will cherish and appreciate the journals we create forever. Hopefully I can pass these on to my kids or something...

Anyway! That's why I created this app.
