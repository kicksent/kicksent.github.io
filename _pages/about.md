### Greetings

This site serves as a place for me to document projects, show off projects, talk about my interests, and hopefully host my new sweet API(coming soon). 


### About me!

I am a self driven, passionate, and ambitious junior developer. I currently work part time as a software engineer for Robauto in Longmont, Colorado. My employer knows that I am looking for full time roles. At Robauto I have worked on a large commercial wordpress site doing optimization and I created my personal site kicksent.dev recently using jekyll. I love all things python. Recently I have really been enjoying the [TalkPython](talkpython.fm) podcast. Although I love python, I consider myself a generalist and have used many object oriented languages and web frameworks. In addition, I have used Docker to build a recent project(my API) and have used pytest for testing projects. At NCAR, I worked on a team using Agile and Jira to track projects and communicate with my team. I understand the value of communication and work well in team settings as well as in isolation when I need to focus hard. I enjoy algorithms and coding challenges and would love to be able to show you what I can accomplish.
