## About Me!  
I am a self driven, passionate, and ambitious junior developer. I currently work part time as a software engineer for Robauto in Longmont, Colorado. 

### Python!  
I love all things python. Recently I have really been enjoying the [TalkPython](talkpython.fm) podcast. Although I love python, I consider myself a generalist and have used many object oriented languages and web frameworks. 

### Current project:
I am building my own API right now using Docker and Flask in python. Although it is not completed I have a link to it's intended functionality[...](/projects/SonnetAPI)

### Agile, Jira, and the value of teamwork  
At NCAR, I worked on a team using Agile and Jira to track projects and communicate with my team. I understand the value of communication and work well in team settings as well as in isolation when I need to focus hard. I enjoy algorithms and coding challenges and would love to be able to show you what I can accomplish.
